# My Musical Background

I've always played instruments growing up from piano to guitar and mostly every brass instrument as well. After I went to college for a music major I really fell in love with the trumpet. It's versatility and clean sound is what really excites me. After college, which I graduated from in 1994, I have had the privledge of performing with most orchestras along the east coast as well as much of the hollywood film scores that you hear that include a brass section. 

#### Teaching

Recently I have really enjoyed teaching my knowledge with future stars in the music industry. I've taught many of the new artists who are currently playing broadway and orchestral sets across the nation.

#### Performances

While I have been enjoying teaching, my true passion is to get up on stage and perform live. There's nothing like being in an orchestra who plays together like a well oiled machine and supports each other.

#### Booking live events

If you would like to book me for a live event, need trumpet player for an upcoming performance, or would just like to get in touch just send me a message on my <Link to="/contact/">Contact Page</Link>.
