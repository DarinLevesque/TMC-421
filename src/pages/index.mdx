I am Ignatius and I play the trumpet. I have been playing trumpet since before Nokia made cellphones. If you know when that was (no cheating) just send me a message on my <Link to="/contact/">Contact page</Link>. Look around and find my musical <Link to="/background/">background</Link>, or where I grew up on the <Link to="/about/">about page</Link>.
